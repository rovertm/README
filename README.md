Hello!

At this time, my repos are primarily `Python` and `Excel`-based data analysis projects. Most of which are declassified tools I've built and utilized in professional settings. 

I've recently began curating a chronology of my self-study [computer science curriculum](https://github.com/rovertm/CS-Curriculum). I find the study fascinating and extremely rewarding.  

I'm a full-time business professional and complete projects and coursework in my spare time.

Please use any / all assets you find useful.

Trevor
